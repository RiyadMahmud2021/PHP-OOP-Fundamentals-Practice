<!-- Class Constants -->
<!-- 

    Constants cannot be changed once it is declared.

    Class constants can be useful if you need to define some constant data within a class.

    A class constant is declared inside a class with the const keyword.

    Class constants are case-sensitive. However, it is recommended to name the constants in all uppercase letters.

    We can access a constant from outside the class by using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator (::) followed by the constant name

 <!-- 
     "::"  is called scope resulation operator.
